  "name": "Basilisk",
  "description": "The Basilisk was a giant serpent, also known as the King of Serpents. It was a magical beast that was usually bred by Dark wizards. Herpo the Foul was the first to breed a Basilisk. Herpo accomplished this by hatching a chicken egg beneath a toad which resulted in the creature known as a Basilisk.\n",
  "longDescription": "Basilisk breeding was banned in Medieval times, a regulation that has not changed. The practice could be hidden when the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures came to check by simply removing the egg from the toad.",
