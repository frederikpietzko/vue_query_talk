  "name": "Mooncalf",
  "description": "The Mooncalf was a shy magical beast that only came out of its burrow during a full moon.",
  "longDescription": "he Mooncalf had smooth, pale grey skin, and four spindly legs that ended in large flat webbed feet. The Mooncalf also had a very long neck and bulging blue eyes that sat on the top of its head.\n\nOnce the Mooncalf was in the moonlight, it performed complicated dance moves while standing on its hind legs. It was believed that this is part of the Mooncalf mating ritual, but also had the side effect of creating geometric patterns in wheat fields that confused Muggles.\n\nMooncalf dung, if harvested before the sun rose, would make magical plants grow fast and strong.",
