  "name": "Centaur",
  "description": "A centaur was a magical creature whose head, torso, and arms appeared to be human and were joined to a horse's lower body. They were, however, their own individual species, and thus were not half-breeds. They also had a rich history and were known for being naturally talented in archery, healing magic, divination and astronomy.\n\nDespite possessing \"human intelligence\", centaurs were classified as Beasts by the British Ministry of Magic, at their own request, as they were unhappy at having to share Being status with hags and vampires, known dark creatures.",
  "longDescription": "Like horses, centaurs could come in a variety of colours, ranging from deep black to white. A centaur by the name of Firenze had white-blonde hair, a body light in colour, and possessed astonishingly blue eyes; Magorian on the other hand possessed black hair and was chestnut in colour. Centaurs had the body of a horse, and the torso, arms, and head of a human. Their upper bodies were so humanlike Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil found the centaur Firenze's human side physically attractive. Centaurs were not in fact half-breeds, but an entirely different species on their own. They were not very pleased to be insulted, particularly where their lineage was concerned, as Dolores Umbridge found out the hard way.\n\nCentaurs were also natural born Seers, in particular the centaur Firenze who taught alongside Sybill Trelawney in Divination class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",
