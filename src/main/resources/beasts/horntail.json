  "name": "Hungarian Horntail",
  "description": "The Hungarian Horntail was a species of dragon native to Hungary, which was considered to be one of the most dangerous dragon breeds, if not the most dangerous. It possessed black scales, a spiked tail, and was lizard-like in appearance.",
  "longDescription": "It had black scales, and was lizard-like in appearance. It also had yellow eyes, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bronze horns and similarly coloured spikes that protruded from its long tail which it would gladly deploy in combat. The dragon's roar was a yowling, screeching scream, and its flame could reach to about fifty feet. While having a very far reaching flame, the Horntail's breath could reach extremely high temperatures, as it made a stone turn red hot in seconds. Its eggs were cement-coloured and particularly hard-shelled. The Horntail's foods of choice included cattle, sheep, goats, and whenever possible, humans. Horntails were also known for being one of the most vicious and aggressive breeds of dragon, and that was saying something since all dragons were known to be ferocious; even Charlie Weasley commented on their ferocity, saying that the Horntail was a \"vicious thing\", and Rubeus Hagrid even regarded it as a \"right nasty piece of work\". This breed was especially aggressive when protecting their young. Young ones were noted to be quicker and more vicious, making them even more dangerous. Along with their viciousness, tail spikes, and fiery breath, Horntails were shown being extremely fast in flight while able to keep up with a Firebolt, a broomstick that was capable of going from 0 to 150 miles per hour in ten seconds. Horntails were also seen able to keep up with Harry Potter's flying skills; a very impressive feat considering Harry's talent as a seeker.",
